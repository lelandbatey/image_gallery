Compression Examples
====================

A comparison of images compressed using `cjpeg` from the
[`mozjpeg`](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) project.

To accurately view compression differences, it is recommended that you open two
images you wish to compare in separate tabs, then rapidly switch between those
two tabs. For even more detailed comparison, zoom in on the same portion of
each image by clicking on a location in one tab to zoom, then *without moving
your mouse* change tabs with `Ctrl-Tab` to the other image and click in the
same location. You'll now be able to tab back and forth between the zoomed in
versions and see the finer details of the differences in compression.


Purpose
-------

I created this page to allow me to visually compare the differences between
each amount of compression so I could find the best compression-to-quality
ratio for a collection of photos which I wanted to keep on all my computers,
but at as small a size as I felt reasonable. I hope it can provide similar
utility to others (and probably my future self) going forward.


Info
----

These photos where taken during the month of July of the year 2016 using a
Nexus 5X at various locations around Washington State by [Leland
Batey](http://lelandbatey.com/). Each image contains it's full original EXIF
data, including GPS coordinates, enabling the curious to find the exact
original locations of each photo.
